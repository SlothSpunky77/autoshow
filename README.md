# What is this project about?
For our web technologies project, I decided to implement a racing video game car selection section using node.js, express.js and React along with mongoDB as a backend (MERN STACK).    
## The highlight of this project:
Instead of having a page for every make, I chose to have one page load the respective car images whenever a different make is chosen. As opposed to the browser loading 'mazda.ejs' when I click on its hyperlink, it brings forth all images under 'mazda' from the database and renders it.
### Footnote:
Make sure you've installed 'express' and 'mongoose' by running ```npm install express``` and ```npm install mongoose``` in the command line inside the directory the files are cloned to.
